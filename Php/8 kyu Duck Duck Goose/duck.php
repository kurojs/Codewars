/*
The objective of Duck, duck, goose is to walk in a circle, tapping on each player's head until one is chosen.

Task:

Given an array of Player objects and a position (first position is 1), return the name of the chosen Player.
name is a property of Player objects, e.g Player.name

Example:

duck_duck_goose([$a, $b, $c, $d], 1); // => $a["name"]
duck_duck_goose([$a, $b, $c, $d], 5); // => $a["name"]
duck_duck_goose([$a, $b, $c, $d], 4); // => $d["name"]
*/

// My solution

function duck_duck_goose($players, $goose) {
  $index = ($goose - 1) % count($players);
  return $players[$index]['name'];
}
