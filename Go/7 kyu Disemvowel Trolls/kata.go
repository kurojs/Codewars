/* Trolls are attacking your comment section!
A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels
from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.

Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new
string with all vowels removed.

For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become
"Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".

Note: for this kata, "y" is not considered a vowel.

// My solution

package kata

import "strings"

func Disemvowel(comment string) string {
	vowels := "aeiouAEIOU"
	var result strings.Builder
	for _, r := range comment {
		if !strings.ContainsRune(vowels, r) {
			result.WriteRune(r)
		}
	}
	return result.String()
}
