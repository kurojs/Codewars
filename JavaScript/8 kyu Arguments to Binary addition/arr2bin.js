/*
Given an array add all the number elements and return the binary equivalent of that sum;
to make the code bullet proof anything else than a number should be added as 0 since it can't be added.

If your language can handle float binaries assume the array won't contain float or doubles.

arr2bin([1,2]) == '11'
arr2bin([1,2,'a']) == '11'
arr2bin([]) == '0'

NOTE: NaN is a number too in javascript for decimal, binary and n-ary base

Return "NaN" if the sum of all numbers is NaN.

This is a modification on the Kata: Array2Binary addition hope you like it

*/

// Solution

function arr2bin(arr) {
  const sum = arr.reduce(
    (acc, val) => acc + (typeof val === "number" ? val : 0),
    0,
  );
  if (isNaN(sum)) return "NaN";
  return sum.toString(2);
}
