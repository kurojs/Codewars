/*
As a part of this Kata, you need to write a function to dismember functions. 
You need to extract the names of all formal arguments of the function from
its definition as an array.

For example, given is a function as shown below:

function add (a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

Running dismember on the function would provide:

dismember(add) => ["a", "b"]

There could be functions that are declared without any explicitly named variables, for example:

function average () {
    return Array.prototype.slice.apply(arguments).reduce(function (a, c) {
        return a + c;
    }, 0) / arguments.length;
}

I'm sure the above function implementation is not the best,
it's not even great and would run into issues when no arguments are passed.
For such functions, return an empty array.

dismember(average) => []

Please note: The internal implementation of the function holds no importance in this Kata,
one just needs to dismember the arguments and return them in the sequence in which they are named.
*/

// Solution

function dismember(func) {
  return func
    .toString()
    .match(/\(([^)]*)\)/)[1]
    .split(",")
    .map((arg) => arg.trim())
    .filter((arg) => arg.length > 0);

  // Implement this function, return an array of names of all formal arguments defined in the function implementation
}
