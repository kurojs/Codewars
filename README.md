# Codewars Practice Repository

## 👾 Overview

This repository contains my daily Codewars practice solutions across multiple programming languages. The goal is to improve problem-solving skills and maintain proficiency in various languages through consistent practice.

## ☕ Languages

- C++
- Go
- Java
- JavaScript
- PHP
- Python
- Rust
- TypeScript

## ✔️ Daily Practice Goals

- Solve at least 5 problem (Katas) per day
- Rotate between different programming languages
- Track coding time using WakaTime
- Focus on understanding different approaches and algorithms

## 🕐 Progress Tracking

- Using WakaTime to track coding time and productivity
- Daily commits to maintain consistency
- Anki-style spaced repetition for reviewing concepts

## Notes

- Each solution includes:
  - Problem description
  - Solution code
  - Time complexity analysis
  - Space complexity analysis
  - Alternative approaches (when applicable)

## Daily Routine

1. Select a problem from Codewars
2. Choose a language to practice
3. Solve the problem
4. Document the solution
5. Track time using WakaTime
6. Commit changes

## 📈 Progress Metrics

- Daily streak tracking
- Language proficiency improvement
- Problem difficulty progression
- Time spent per language
